# Ansible Collection - rockprofile.ssl

This collection serves a very specific need, the ability to create a Lets Encrypt
SSL certificate using DNS validation. This can be useful when issuing certificates
that will be available on a private LAN.

At present this contains all of the tasks in one role but this will be split out in future.
